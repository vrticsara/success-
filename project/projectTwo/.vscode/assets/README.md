The second project,  one that I am currently working on is also related to movies, as the first project was. Project 2 is made as a site on which you can see some Hollywood and Japanese movies that are available for sale, as they can be bought and then viewed on your PC. It is made by some principles where you can select which type of resolution you want (HD, SD, 4K Ultra HD ) and of course clearer the video is, the pricier it is. git
